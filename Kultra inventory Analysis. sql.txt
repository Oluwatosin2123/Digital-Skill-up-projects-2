------Questions and Recommendation---

---4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom

--11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and 
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company 
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer---


----Question 4-----

FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study2]
Group by Customer_Segment
ORDER BY [Total Revenue] Asc

SELECT TOP 10 Customer_Segment, Sum(Sales) As [Total Revenue] 
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study2]
Group by Customer_Segment
ORDER BY [Total Revenue] Desc
-----Recommendation for Question 4-----
-- Set a target for the top 4 from the bottom Revenue---
----Revenue_Gap AS (
    SELECT 
        5500000.0 * 4 AS Target_Revenue,

    FROM Total_Bottom_Revenue t
)
-- Final Output
  ----  Target_Revenue,
 ---- Bottom_Total_Revenue,
 --- Revenue_Gap
  ---FROM Revenue_Gap;

----Question 11
SELECT
    Order_Priority,
    Ship_Mode,
    COUNT(Order_ID) AS Order_Count,
    SUM(Sales - Profit) AS Estimated_Shipping_Cost,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, Order_Date, Ship_Date)) AS Average_Shipping_Days
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study2]
GROUP BY
    Order_Priority,
    Ship_Mode
ORDER BY
    Order_Priority,
    Ship_Mode DESC

----Recommendation for Question 11----
	---Since the Express Air and Regular Air has more high order priority and order count Kultra Iventory should increase the shipping cost
	--base on the Order Quantity so that the company will have a profitable gain and not lost.
